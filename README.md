# Lunamancy
Initially I wanted to make a mod that generates power for mods that need power, so that you can use machines with magic, or something, in order to learn modding with Fabric. Then I started doing anything, and I decided I wanted one of everything. Not that I'm going to make a list or anything. I'm probably gonna rename it to Moon Power or something, because _moon things_.

## Additions

Currently adds:
- Silver and Moonstone, important materials in moon magic.
- An AI-less luna moth that will drop dust?
- A clock that tells the phase of the moon.

## Credits
Most textures are made by **capnkiddd**, all others are made by me.
