# Lunamancy
I wanted to make a mod that generates mods that need power, so that you can use machines with magic, in order to learn modding with Fabric. It started out as Magic Power, but it's always been about the moon, so I finally decided to rename it. _Lunacy_ was a close second.

Then I started doing anything, like one of everything. All of it revolves around moonlight and the moon. The main gimmick is that there are two forms of moonlight -- currently called _white_ and _black_. White moonlight is power that comes from the lit parts of the moon, while black moonlight is power that comes from the unlit (by the sun, anyway) parts of the moon.

The thing that made me start modding and modding this specifically was playing with [Ember Rekindled](https://github.com/DaedalusGame/EmbersRekindled), because they have little particle packets of ember for transmitting energy instead of boring wires, and that's _neat_.

## Additions

Currently adds:
- Silver and Moonstone, important materials in moon magic.
- Dusts to make ritual circles, someday.
- A basin to collect moonlight, with glass lenses to enhance or diminish collection. 
- An AI-less luna moth that will drop dust for something maybe?
- A clock that tells the phase of the moon ~~that I'll probably get rid of for something else~~.

Would be nice if it added:
- Network for power transmission
- A luna moth with AI
- Ore duplication, the classic
- Magic rituals
- Things that actually use collected power at all

## Plans

At the moment I'm (finally) working on the moonlight network parts. I'm generally coming up with stuff as I go, but I have some vague plans (as seen in my feature diagram!).

I also feel like I should get the moth going, the poor guy has been waiting for a while.
