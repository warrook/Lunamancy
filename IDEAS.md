- Make lenses care about weather, and make a lens that doesn't care about weather (at a small cost (it takes some of the moonlight to power the enchantment), but much smaller than the traditional lenses)
- Tiers -- wood/stone or something, then iron, then silver
- Moonwells to store vast amounts of moonlight; it glows based on contents but mostly doesn't change light level
